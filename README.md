# Jamboree-Case-Study

(Linear Reression)

Jamboree has introduced a feature to estimate students' probabilities of gaining admission to Ivy League colleges, specifically from an Indian perspective. While the feature provides valuable insights, it requires a more data-driven and accurate approach to enhance its predictive capabilities.

The goal of this project is to analyze the key factors influencing graduate admissions and build a predictive model that can estimate a student's likelihood of admission. By identifying and understanding the relationships between variables such as academic scores, test results, extracurricular activities, and other relevant data points, we can provide actionable insights for prospective students.

This analysis will support Jamboree in refining its admission prediction tool, ultimately helping students make more informed decisions about their academic applications.
